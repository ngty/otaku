=== Current

= Features
* it is now possible to specify which ruby to run the server in [#ngty]

= Maintenance
* split single file into separate files for readability [#ngty]
* use RubyParser instead of ParseTree [#ngty]

= Issues
* magic variable __FILE__ works as expected, but not __LINE__, in fact, __LINE__ reflects the
  line no starting from the line where the source code is extracted from (not sure if we wanna
  fix this problem though, unless someone explicitely ask for it)

=== 0.1.0 2010-07-18
