=== 0.4.0 2010-09-15

= Features
* Use SerializableProc instead of handrolled MagicProc & friends, thus doing away
  with the awkward need for explicitely passing in contextual references [#ngty]

=== 0.3.0 2010-08-05

= Features
* Proc can now be passed as a context to Otaku.start [#ngty]

= Maintenance
* Cleaning up Otaku::Handler [#ngty]

=== 0.2.2 2010-07-21

= Features
* $LOAD_PATH include the directory where the file calling Otaku.start is located, thus
  user no longer need to verbosely define the full path of the file to require [#ngty]

= Maintenance
* magic variable __FILE__ is now derived the same way as __LINE__ (see below) [#ngty]

= Bug Fixes
* magic variable __LINE__ now works as expected (the line where the proc is defined in file,
  instead of the string eval line) [#ngty]
* fixed unexpected failure in specs as a result of using installed otaku, instead of the
  one under current project directory (by passing -I when running the sub-process server
  script) [#ngty]

=== 0.2.1 2010-07-19

= Maintenance
* logging support is moved directly under Otaku module [#ngty]

= Bug Fixes
* closing of logger is done ONLY if the logger has been initialized [#ngty]

=== 0.2.0 2010-07-19

= Features
* it is now possible to specify which ruby to run the server in [#ngty]
* officially support MRI-1.8.7, MRI-1.9.1, JRUBY-1.5.1 & REE-1.8.7 [#ngty]

= Maintenance
* split single file into separate files for readability [#ngty]
* use RubyParser instead of ParseTree [#ngty]

= Issues
* magic variable __FILE__ works as expected, but not __LINE__, in fact, __LINE__ reflects the
  line no starting from the line where the source code is extracted from (not sure if we wanna
  fix this problem though, unless someone explicitely ask for it)

=== 0.1.0 2010-07-18
